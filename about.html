  <h5>Purpose</h5>
<p>This tool was designed for Massachusetts residents who rely on a public water system for their drinking water. Public water systems are required to provide residents with a Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) annually. This CCR details the results of all water testing done by a public water system in that year. Call or go online to your local water department to find out more.</p>
