    <h3> About this tool</h3>
  <br>
  <h5>Purpose</h5>
<p>This tool was designed for Massachusetts residents who rely on a public water system for their drinking water. Public water systems are required to provide residents with a Consumer Confidence Report (CCR) annually. The CCR details the results of all water testing done by a public water system in that year. Call or go online to your local water department to find out more.</p>

<br>

<h5>About the data</h5>
<p>Water data for MA public water systems retrieved from: <a href="https://eeaonline.eea.state.ma.us/Portal/#!/search/drinking-water">https://eeaonline.eea.state.ma.us/Portal/#!/search/drinking-water</a> (last download: Jan 2022)</p>

<p> All Community Water Systems in Massachusetts that reported PFAS water testing to the State are included. PFAS compounds were included if they  were detected in at least 100 samples or in the Massachusetts drining water standard. Compounds and detection frequencies included in the tool are as follows:</p>
<li>PFDA (3%)</li>
<li>PFNA (21%)</li>
<li>PFBS (60%)</li>
<li>PFHxS (60%)</li>
<li>PFAS6 (60%)</li>
<li>PFHpA (61%)</li>
<li>PFHxA (65%)</li>
<li>PFOS (67%)</li>
