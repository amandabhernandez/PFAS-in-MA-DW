<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>How are PFAS regulated in drinking water? What is a "Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)" ?</b> </summary>

<p>There is currently no federal drinking water standard in place for PFAS. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a non-inforceable health advisory of 70 ng/L for the sum of two PFAS chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. </p>
<p>In October 2020, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) finalized a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 20 ng/L for the sum of six PFAS compounds (PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS, PFNA, PFHpA, and PFDA).</p>

<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>What does "ng/L" mean?</b> </summary>

<p>PFAS concentrations in drinking water are typically shown as "ng/L", or nanograms per liter. This is also sometimes written as parts per trillion (ppt). </p>

<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>My town exceeded the Massachusetts DEP MCL of 20 ng/L for the sum of 6 PFAS. What does that mean? </b> </summary>

<p>Public water systems in Massachusetts that exceed 20 ng/L for the the sum of 6 PFAS must take corrective action. Your public water system is required to notify customers of the exceedances and share public education materials within 30 days.</p>
</details>

<br>

<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>What does "Not Detected" mean?</b> </summary>

<p> A testing result may be "Not Detected" if the PFAS chemical is not present at all or if it is present at a low level that the laboratory cannot reliably measure.</p>

<br>

<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>Why is my town not available in the report tool? Why has my town not tested for PFAS?</b> </summary>
<p>This report was generated using publically available drinking water testing data. Towns report the results of their water testing to the state and they are uploaded into a database that is maintained by the State. Your town may not be included if they did not report PFAS testing to the State. </p>

<p> Some towns have been testing regularly for PFAS for several years due to known or suspected contamination. The new Massachusetts drinking water standard for PFAS requires all Community Public Water Systems to monitor for 6 PFAS in public drinking water beginning in 2021. This data for this tool was downloaded in early January 2022, so it may not reflect most recent testing results.</p>

<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>I have a private well. Should I be concerned about PFAS? </b> </summary>

<p> PFAS chemicals have been detected in private wells in some areas of Massachusetts. Private well owners are not required to test their well water, but the state does have resources for private well owners looking to test their water for PFAS. For more information, including a testing program currently offered by DEP, visit the state's <a href= "https://www.mass.gov/info-details/per-and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas-in-private-well-drinking-water-supplies-faq">FAQ for PFAS and Private Wells page</a>.</p>

<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>How else can I be exposed to PFAS?</b> </summary>
<p> PFAS are common in many consumer products. They are commonly used to make products non-stick, grease-proof, stain-resistant, and water-proof. Studies have detected PFAS in treated carpeting, furnishings, and apparel. They have also been measured in fast food packaging, pizza boxes, microwave popcorn bags, some cosmetics, and dental floss. </p>

<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>How can my family reduce our risk of exposure to PFAS?</b> </summary>
<p>There are several steps you can take to reduce exposures in your home and community: </p>
<li>Eat fresh foods to avoid PFAS-coated food packaging, such as pizza boxes, fast food wrappers, microwave popcorn bags, and take-out containers.</li>
<li>Avoid non-stick cookware in favor of cast iron or stainless steel. </li>
<li>Avoid furnishings and upholstery that are stain-resistant or water-proof. </li>
<li>Filter your drinking water using an activated carbon or reverse osmosis filter.  Activated carbon includes solid carbon block filters (typically a filter under a sink) and granular activated carbon (such as a pitcher filter). Reverse osmosis systems are more effective at removing PFAS. However, reverse osmosis systems can be more expensive and create a lot of wastewater. Look for a filter that is certified by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to remove PFAS (look for "NSF P472 certified" or "NSF/ANSI 53 certified"). Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions and replace the filters as recommended.

<li>Join or support a local community group that is working on PFAS or water quality. You can find ones in your community using this <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/7d098a603c664a9e91f4f88c1c89e5d1/page/Page-1/?views=Community-Resources">Connecting Communities tool</a></li>

<details class = "details"><summary class = "summary"> <b>What about other contaminants? How do I find out more about water testing in my town?</b> </summary>

<p>Public water systems are required to provide residents with a Consumer Confidence Report annually. This report details the results of all water testing done by a public water system in that year. Call or go online to your local water department to find out more. </p>
