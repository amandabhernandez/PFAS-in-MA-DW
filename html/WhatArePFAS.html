<p>Per- and polyfluoralkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of man-made fluorinated chemicals that companies add to a wide range of consumer products. These chemicals are added to products to make them non-stick, stain-resistant, and water-proof. Some firefighting foams used at local fire departments and airports also contain PFAS. </p>


<p>PFAS have strong chemical bonds, so they stay in the environment for a long time and do not easily break down. People can be exposed to PFAS through their drinking water. They can also be exposed through products and food. One study found that at least 16.5 million people in the U.S. had detectable levels of PFAS in their drinking water. Nearly all Americans have PFAS in their blood.</p>
