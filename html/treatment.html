<p> PFAS can be removed from drinking water with two types of filters: activated carbon and reverse osmosis. </p>
<li>Activated carbon includes solid carbon block filters (typically a filter under a sink) and granular activated carbon (such as a pitcher filter).</li> 
<li>Reverse osmosis systems are more effective at removing PFAS. However, reverse osmosis systems can be more expensive and create a lot of wastewater. </li>
<br>
<p>Look for a filter that is certified by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to remove PFAS. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and replace the filters as recommended.
